# MicrosoftMalware_project
The goal of this project is to predict likeliness of a Windows machine to be hit by malware soon. The data comes from an on-going Kaggle competition which consists of various different properties of a Windows machine. According to the competition description, the data was gathered from threat reports by Windows Defender. The data set contains a list of unique machines that have been identified to have an infection or not. With this data, we will be able to learn more about the attributes of a machine are more likely to be attacked by malware and furthering the safety of other machine users.
